# Yatong Lan / 兰亚彤

I am currently an Autonomous Driving Research Intern at Tsinghua University's School of Vehicle and Mobility, where I focus on developing robust perception systems and intelligent decision-making algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Previously, I worked as an Algorithm Intern at Guanglun Intelligence, gaining valuable experience in computer vision and deep learning applications for autonomous driving. My research interests include computer vision, sensor fusion, motion planning, and control systems for autonomous vehicles. I am passionate about advancing autonomous driving technology and contributing to the future of transportation.
