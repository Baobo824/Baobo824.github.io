# Baobo Xiong / 熊宝博

I am currently studying in the Physics Track of Zhili College, Tsinghua University. I am now part of Professor Chen Hong's research group at the School of Integrated Circuits, focusing on research into UAV high-speed obstacle avoidance and target detection algorithms based on DVS and RGB images. Previously, I engaged in condensed matter research in Professor Wei Bin's group at the Department of Physics. Later, hoping to combine the complex system analysis capabilities and "structure-function" research logic of physics with engineering technology to solve practical problems, I shifted to the field of intelligent algorithms, exploring the "theory-application" implementation path.
